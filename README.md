# DevelopForHighAvailabilityReliabilityResiliency

Udacity Cloud Architect Nanodegree Project 1 Recoverability in AWS

Project Overview

In this project, I have created highly available solutions for common use cases.

- Built a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and showed how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.
- Built a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
