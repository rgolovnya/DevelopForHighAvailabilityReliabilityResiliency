Recovery Time Objective RTO or the time that your application can be down for a given incident.
Recover Point Objective RPO or a measure of how long of a period that data can be lost.

Recover Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum time your platform or service can be unavailable.

1. Minimum Recover Time Objective RTO for a single AZ outage:
If a multi-AZ configuration is set up, the fail over to another AZ will happen automatically
 which can take a few minutes.

2. Minimum Recover Time Objective RTO for a single region outage:
·         00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
·         00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
·         00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
·         00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
·         00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
·         00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
·         00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
·         00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)

Total time: 56 minutes

3. Minimum Recover Point Objective RPO for a single AZ outage:
 In Multi-AZ scenario, automatic backups are enabled. It means AWS will take full snapshot once a day.
 AWS also does transactional log backups every 5 minutes. if this is case then the most data that would be lost woud be 5 minutes.

4. Minimum Recover Point Objective RPO for a single region outage:
If we set up an RDS database with automatic backups enabled, the RPO will be based on how often data is backed up.
It measure of the window of time that you may lose data in.
 If we set up a backup every 7 hours, the minimun RPO will be 7 hours.
